### 导航
#### VLN-Go2-Matterport
Overview
This dataset is designed for training and evaluating models on Vision Language Navigation task. It is collected using unitree go2 navigating through indoor environments from the Matterport dataset (provided by VLN-CE-Isaac benchmark), rendered with Isaac Lab. Each episode in the dataset represents a navigation task where the robot follows an expert path using a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller, capturing visual observations (RGB images and depth maps) and discrete actions at regular intervals (40 simulation steps). The dataset is intended to support research in areas such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and vision-language navigation.

#### ember-lab-berkeley/AMASS_Retargeted_for_G1
Overview
Retargeted AMASS Dataset for G1
This repository contains 100% of the AMASS dataset retargeted to the G1 humanoid and formatted for use with IsaacLab's AMP motion loader.

It should also be compatible with ProtoMotions.

The retargeting data is taken from https://huggingface.co/datasets/fleaven/Retargeted_AMASS_for_robotics

#### ember-lab-berkeley/LAFAN-G1
This repository contains 100% of the LAFAN dataset retargeted to the G1 humanoid and formatted for use with IsaacLab's AMP motion loader.

It should also be compatible with ProtoMotions.

The original retargeting data was released by Unitree.

Retargeted AMASS for Robotics
Project Overview
This project aims to retarget motion data from the AMASS dataset to various robot models and open-source the retargeted data to facilitate research and applications in robotics and human-robot interaction. AMASS (Archive of Motion Capture as Surface Shapes) is a high-quality human motion capture dataset, and the SMPL-X model is a powerful tool for generating realistic human motion data.

By adapting the motion data from AMASS to different robot models, we hope to provide a more diverse and accessible motion dataset for robot training and human-robot interaction.

## 大模型
### 世界模型
NVIDIA Cosmos now includes three subprojects:

Cosmos-Predict1 is a collection of general-purpose world foundation models for Physical AI that can be fine-tuned into customized world models for downstream applications.
Cosmos-Transfer1 is a world-to-world transfer model designed to bridge the perceptual divide between simulated and real-world environments.
Cosmos-Reason1 models understand the physical common sense and generate appropriate embodied decisions in natural language through long chain-of-thought reasoning processes.

#### Cosmos-Transfer1: A Suite of Diffusion-based World-to-World Transfer Models
Model Overview
Description:
Cosmos-Transfer1 Models: A family of highly performant pre-trained world foundation models that are designed to generate videos aligned with the input control conditions.

The Cosmos Transfer1 models are a collection of diffusion-based world foundation models that generate dynamic, high quality videos from text and control video inputs. It can serve as the building block for various applications or research that are related to world generation. The models are ready for commercial use.
